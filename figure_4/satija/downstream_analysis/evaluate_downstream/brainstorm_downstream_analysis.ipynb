    "- z-scores for all combinations in Figure 3\n",
    "    - includes conserved perturbation programs (IFNG & IFNB) and less conserved programs (TGFB1 & INS)\n",
    "    - pre-selected/no further analysis necessary and somewhat motivated, but could be criticised?\n",
    "- perturbation programs for each pathway returned by MultiCCA\n",
    "    - MultiMCCA can return multiple perturbation programs for each pathway\n",
    "    - but: identifies conserved programs accross cell lines, so not really what we want to analyse\n",
    "    - could be an interesting point: for INS pathway, MultiMCCA failed to return clear perturbation programs due to extensive heterogeneity and minimal conservation in cell-type specific response\n",
    "        - for this, cell line specific perturbation responses were learned! --> see Supplementarty Table 4\n",
    "- alternatively, we could try to distinguish pathway responses --> z-scores between all pathways and predictions\n",
